	<p>I am very simple person, who believe in leading as simple life as it should be.I know the technologies are there to make the human life better, but when anything excersized without caution/ not in limits, it would cause more damage than the advantage it is intended to gain. </p><br/>
	
	<p>Living in Bangalore city wth challenges like water shortage, pollution and over population, i always wish to live in a place without causing much damage to nature like any other creature on earth.I love nature, morning walks in Lal bagh and visiting any place which is full of green. Trying out small eateries in south bangalore is also one of my hobby.
